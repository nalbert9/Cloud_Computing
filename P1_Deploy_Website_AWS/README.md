# Cloud Fundamentals Project
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, we will deploy a static website to AWS. First, we will create a S3 bucket and upload the website files to our bucket. Next, we will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies. Next, we will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, we will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
