# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

In this project, we will start with the "Udagram - photo sharing" Monolith application and divide the application into smaller (micro)services. Each microservice must run in a separate Docker container. These containers (and ReplicaSets) have to be managed by using the Kubernetes cluster.
